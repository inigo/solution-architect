Solution architect - a storytelling game for consultants

Building
--------

Apply the XSLT to the cards.xml to create XSL:FO, then process (e.g. with FOP) to produce a PDF. Print onto Avery L7165 labels (A4, 2 x 4). Stick labels onto playing cards.

Rules
-----

One player is the customer, the other players are vendors.

The customer describes their problem.

Each vendor presents their solution in turn. When they use a phrase referenced on a card they hold, they add that card to their own solution stack in front of them. If the currently presenting vendor mentions a solution owned by another vendor, then the other vendor adds a card to the currently presenting vendor's stack.

After all vendors have given their presentations, the customer accepts a solution stack and these technologies are discarded.
